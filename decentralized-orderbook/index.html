<h1 id="title">Decentralizing the Order Book</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p id="bodyText">
    With the emergence of new technologies inefficiencies in current systems or protocols become apparent. The
    hypothesis
    in the below project is that block chain technology can create a new order book protocol that eliminates the
    most exploitable inefficiency: Front running by order book owner.
</p>

<h2> Inefficiencies in Centralized Order Books </h2>
<p id="bodyText">
    In addition to the well known advantages gained from using a decentralized system vs a centralized system, with a
    decentralized order book I believe the well known and exploitable inefficiency of front running can be solved.

    The below exert from a book I recently read, "The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution" by Gregory Zuckerman,
    is one example of how front running is used to cheat and gain an unfair advantage over the trader and the rest of the market

    Whenever Medallion traded Canadian dollars, the fund seemed to lose
    money. Almost every trade was a dud. It didn’t seem to make sense—the model said Medallion should be racking up
    money, but they were losing, over and over, every day. One afternoon, Berlekamp shared his frustrations with Simons,
    who called a trader on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade to get his take on their problems. “Don’t you know,
    Jim?” the trader told him, with a chuckle. “Those guys are crooks.” Only three traders on the exchange focused on
    Canadian dollar futures, and they worked hand-in-hand to take advantage of customers naive enough to transact with
    them.

    When Simons’s team placed a buy order, the brokers shared the information, and the traders immediately
    purchased Canadian dollar contracts for themselves, pushing the price up just a tad, before selling to Simons and
    pocketing the difference as profit. They’d do the opposite if Medallion was selling; the small differences in price
    were enough to turn the Canadian dollar trades into losers. It was one of Wall Street’s oldest tricks, but Berlekamp
    and his fellow academics were oblivious to the practice.

    Similar to BTC, the theory behind decentralized order books is cannot completely gurantee an efficient
    orderbook yet. However, the simulation explores if it could work in practice as well as BTC works in practice .

<p id="bodyText">
    the block chain can be used as an independent module for providing new functionalities—a template that can be
    emulated for the decentralization of many different services.

<h2> Incentive Engineering </h2>
<p id="bodyText">take note that the mechanism through which Bitcoin achieves decentralization is not purely technical,
    but it’s a combination of technical methods and clever incentive engineering.

<p id="bodyText">
    Game theory tells us to not assume that every node is honest, but that instead to assume that every node will want
    to maximize profit or act accoring to their incentive.
</p>
<p id="bodyText">
    We can't send cash to honest nodes because we do not know their identitiess. but we can give them bitcoin because it
    is a digital ccy
</p>
<p id="bodyText">
    Each node picks a (randomized) strategy to maximize its payoff, taking into account other nodes’ potential
    strategies. If the protocol and incentives are designed well, then most nodes will follow the rules most of the
    time. “Honest” behavior is just one strategy of many, and we attach no particular moral salience to it.

    In the game theoretic view, the big question is whether the default miner behavior is a “Nash equilibrium,” that is,
    whether it represents a stable situation in which no miner can realize a higher payoff by deviating from honest
    behavior. This question is still contentious and an active area of research.

    analyzing whether it makes sense to mine is a complicated game theory question
